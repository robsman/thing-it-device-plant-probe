## Installation

Install the **thing-it Mobile App** from the Apple Appstore or Google Play and set it up to connect to **[thing-it-node]** 
locally as described [here](https://thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/connectionModes) or just connect your browser under 
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to check how the Mobile UI would look like.
